In this project, I worked on the following React and JavaScript concepts:
✅ React Functional Components for modular UI development
✅ Props to pass data between components
✅ Rendering lists with Array.map and unique keys
✅ Conditional rendering for dynamic UI updates
✅ Using external libraries (react-markdown for Markdown support)
✅ Hugging Face API integration for AI-powered recipe suggestions
✅ Handling async operations with Async/Await
✅ Environment variables (.env) for secure API key storage
