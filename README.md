In this project, I worked on the following React and JavaScript concepts:

- ✅ React Functional Components for modular UI development  
- ✅ Props to pass data between components  
- ✅ Rendering lists with Array.map and unique keys  
- ✅ Conditional rendering for dynamic UI updates  
- ✅ Using external libraries (react-markdown for Markdown support)  
- ✅ Hugging Face API integration for AI-powered recipe suggestions  
- ✅ Handling async operations with Async/Await  
- ✅ Environment variables (.env) for secure API key storage
